# The list of all possible conditions that plays that make up a play's 
# scenario block. 
#
# Each "condition" refers to the percent chance that a particular control or 
# condition results in the thing you don't want to happen. For 
# example, we want the condition to be "malware affects Windows" and not
# "malware doesn't affect Windows", since that's how the program performs its
# calculations.
